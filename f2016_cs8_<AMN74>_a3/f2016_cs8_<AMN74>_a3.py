#CS 0008 – Fall 2016 Assignment #3 Due: 2016/11/18
#CS 0008 - Introduction to programming with Python
#Fall 2016
#Assignment #3
#Available: 2016/11/15. Due: 2016/11/18 before midnight.
#Students are to write a python program that address the problem describe below under the description
#section.
#Students will need to commit the assignment in their git repository under a new folder named:
#• f2016_cs8_<pitt-username>_a3
#<pitt-username> needs to be substituted with the student pitt username. My pitt username is man8, so
#my folder will be named f2016_cs8_man8_a3.
#Inside the assignment folder, students have to commit at least the following three files:
#• f2016_cs8_<pitt-username>_a3.readme.txt:
#simple text file describing the thought process that was used to write the program.
#• f2016_cs8_<pitt-username>_a3.py
#python program
#• f2016_cs8_<pitt-username>_a2.run1.txt:
#simple text file containing one test run of the program. It has to show input provided by the
#user, if present and output produced by the program. This file is going to be used by the
#instructors to test the code and will contribute to the assignment grade. If the student wold like
#to submit multiple test files, he/she should commit more changing run1 to run2 and so forth.
#Program has to be in python version 3.x and they will be graded according the following factors:
#• submissions:
#Files and folder has been submitted with correct naming.
#• run:
#Python script runs correctly with python 3.x. Correct output.
#• logic:
#Program follow simple logic. Missing or extra functionalities. Redundant code.
#• beautification:
#Comments, readability, code spacing and organization
#IMPORTANT:
#• Instructors will grade the last commit before midnight of Friday 2016/11/18.
#• Do not wait the last minute to commit.
#• Please commit your work-in-progress as many time as you can.
#• No late commits, no extensions (unless previously agreed).
#• Do not be afraid to ask question and search examples
#• Four test files are provided on CourseWeb: f2016_cs8_a3.data.txt, f2016_cs8_a3.data.1.csv,
#f2016_cs8_a3.data.2.csv, and f2016_cs8_a3.data.3.csv

#CS 0008 – Fall 2016 Assignment #3 Due: 2016/11/18
#Description
#A customer needs to process a number of text files (called data files) that contain names and distance
#run by study participants. The format of those files is as follows:
#Max,34.23
#Barbara,23.00
#Luka,12.87
#…
#In those files, each row is a comma separated list of 2 values: the first one is the name of the participant
#and the second is the distance that the participant has run.
#The names of the input files are stored one per line in an additional file, called the master input list.
#This file has the following structure:
#<data file 1>
#<data file 2>
#<data file 3>
#…
#Write a program that read the master input list file, retrieves the names of the data files and from each
#one of them reads every line, extract name and distance. Once the program has all the data in memory,
#it has to compute the following quantities and informations:
#• number of files read in input
#• total number of lines read
#• total distance run (aka the sum of all the distances loaded from provided files)
#• total distance run for each individual participant
#• individual maximum distance run and by which participant
#• individual minimum distance run and by which participant
#• report if there are any participants that appears more than once, how many times and their
#names
#• total number of participants
#The program should provide an terminal output similar to the following:
#Number of Input files read : xx
#Total number of lines read : xx
#total distance run : xxxx.xxxxx
#max distance run : xxxx.xxxxx
# by participant : participant name
#Page 2 of 3
#CS 0008 – Fall 2016 Assignment #3 Due: 2016/11/18
#min distance run : xxxx.xxxxx
# by participant : participant name
#Total number of participants : xx
#Number of participants
 #with multiple records : xx
#The program should also create an output file reporting name of the participant, how many times their
#name appears in the input files and the total distance run. Each row should be as follows:
#Max,3,124.23
#Barbara,2,65.00
#Luka,1,12.87
#…
#A zip file named f2016_cs8_a3.data.zip is provided with this assignment. It contains the following
#additional files that are to be used to test assignment #3:
#• f2016_cs8_a3.data.txt: master input list
#• f2016_cs8_a3.data.1.csv: data file 1
#• f2016_cs8_a3.data.2.csv: data file 2
#• f2016_cs8_a3.data.3.csv: data file 3
#The output file mentioned above, that has to be created by the student program, should be named:
#• f2016_cs8_<username>_a3.data.output.csv
#In this program, the student should make the best us of everything that has learn so far in this class:
#functions, for loops, while loops, lists, sets and dictionaries.
