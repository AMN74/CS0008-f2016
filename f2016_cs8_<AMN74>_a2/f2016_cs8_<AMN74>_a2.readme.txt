In this assignment we had to take 2 seperate .csv data files and write a program that loops all the data from the
file that is inputed into the program. To start the projet I saved both data files. Then I started writing out the
program. When I sat down to do this I was confused as to how I could seperate the data within the file. Because of this I didn't
really know how to start. After Thursdays lecture I felt like a had a way better understanding as to how to write and
complete the program, as well as the logic behind the program.

In terms of actually writing the program first I defined a function and added in two seperate variables.
One variable was for the partial total number of lines and the other variable was for the partial distance.

Then, using a for loop I removed the the new line in the string (\n) . I split the data that is given seperating
the name from the numerical value (splitting ","). Then created variables that will count the total number of names
and total distance run (or times the program looped).

Futhermore, I created a function that would take the key, value, and length. Then I properly formatted the output which
included: telling the program that the string should be 20 spaces long and telling the program that there should be a total
of 10 spaces with 3 decimals.

Additionally I, created a variable for total lines. Created a variable for total distance. Prompted the user to which
file name needs to be read. Created a while loop that lets the program know what to do when the user does not type in 'quit'.
Then I used operators that would add the total number of lines as well as added the total distance. Finally I created
print statements to output the data.
