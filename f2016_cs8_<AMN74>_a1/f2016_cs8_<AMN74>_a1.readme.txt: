The first thing I did to write this program was make an outline of the program on a piece of paper. This way I could
figure out how many variables I needed as well as create a structure for the program itself. After I did this, I
started actually writing the program. First thing I did is create three different prompts. The first line asks the
user is they are using USC or Metric units for the values they will enter. The second line asks the user "What is
the distance driven?" and the third line asks the user 'how much gas is used?'. The user is prompted these questions
so that we can calculate the miles, gallons, mpg, km, liters, 1/100km based on the unit system the user is using.
On line 5 I created a conversion factor that would convert the miles to kilometers. On line 6 I created a
conversion factor that would convert kilometers to miles. Line 8 has a variable that will convert kilometers to miles.
Line 9 has a variable that will convert liters to gallons. line 11 has the variable cm value if the user inputs values
in USC. Line 12 has the variable cm value if the user inputs values in metric. Lines 16-19 are outputted if the user
inputs USC. These lines have the output template and values. Lines 22-25 consists of the same thing excpet these lines
are outputted if the user enters Metric. The else statement is there so that an ERROR message will pop up if the user
does not enter Metric or USC and the input is case sensitive. In order to execute the output I used if-elif-else.
This is demonstrated in lines 15-28. Lines 32-41 consists of conditional statements that will output the correct
the gas consumption rating. These values are based on the given table.
